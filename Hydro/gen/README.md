## Welcome Readers!

Thanks for checking out this version 1.0 
In this version you will learn about the project / 
the innovation that genearates electrical
via PSI coversion using a fly-wheel generator.

## Hydro Water Generator Wheel

 **Hydro** Mini Water Generator Wheel 
 **Hydro** Hookups pvc framework

 **hydro** flywheel and water wheel for electrical generation
 produced from the motor that runs the wheel IO asyncronously



## About The Technology (Core Vision)

**Generator** DC power input output redirect loopback
**Generator** +DC_Power/For Utility Battery Charger

About The Technology (Core Vision) The basic idea
is to control the water-flow (PSI) of the system
then control the power outputs unlocking the potential
of the system is knowing the basic outputs in a minimal
way that way when you have more or less water the system
should read differently closed system of water vs taking out
some water if needed the system of water would generally never
be touched as the power outputs should be steady and constant
with the water flowing and circulation being achieved inside 
the system wheel that is connected to the water track.



## DC Power Charging Machine

 2x Battery Bank Array one for pump and other from wheel
  - Scalable Wheel Technology

How small and how big is a reasonible for power generation


## About The Project

A utility patent project turning an idea into a applicable drawlings to prove what I could build the device for energy.

Waterwheel energy production unit

Produces power output has plugins for modules
and other connectable devices like usb and type-C


## Features Updater Technology

- Backwards comptable technology
- Easy to build and configure
- Easy mods and install cheatcodes.plx
